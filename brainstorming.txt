Approaches:
 - try to fulfill each phase
 - generate all possible set/run combos

 - start from scratch vs build off previous phases
 
 Going phase by phase:
 - generate all sets and generate all runs -> vet all phases except 2 and 3
 - for phase 2 and 3 for all possible runs of 4 create sets from remaining cards if max set is large enough phase gets a pass


Logistics:
 - Ask for input or generate random
 - Validate user inputted hand


Notes:
 - sets are mutually exclusive, runs are mutually exclusive
 - overlap between sets and runs
